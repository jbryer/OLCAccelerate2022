#### Mathematics Anxiety Survey Scale

There are many self-efficacy and anxiety scales for specific subjects. For my statistics course, I use the [Mathematics Anxiety Survey Scale](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-20155-001) developed by Bai, Wang, Pan, and Frey (2011). This is administered at the beginning of the course and the results are shared, in aggregate, during one of the first synchronous meetings.

We gave also used the [Self-Regulated Learning assessment](https://daacs.net/blog/2019/04/2019-04-01-futurereview/) (Lui et. al, 2018) from the [Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS)](https://daacs.net). DAACS is a suite of technological and social supports to optimize student learning. Although it was designed to assist students transitioning into college, we have found it to be an effective tool within the classroom.
