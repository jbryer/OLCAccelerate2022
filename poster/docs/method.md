The formative assessments and one-minute papers are administered through [Google Forms](http://forms.google.com). Results are then downloaded into R using the [`googlesheets`](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4) package. Since I use R markdown to build my slides, I can include the results directly and they are automatically updated with each week's results.

For those who don't use R, there are several services that allow embedding live survey results into PowerPoint including: [Vevox](https://www.vevox.com/powerpoint-polling), [Slido](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiB2dKSmqz7AhUZF2IAHf0NBSwQFnoECC0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.slido.com%2Fpowerpoint-polling&usg=AOvVaw3kZEKdYqG_RVI-bvVHo2Zl), [Polls Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com)
