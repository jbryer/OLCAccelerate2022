For students to be successful in online learning environments they need to be self-motivated and goal-directed, making effective use of learning strategies for learning and for managing competing demands. These are the cornerstone qualities of self-regulated learners (Zimmerman et al., 2011; Zimmerman & Schunk). Students who possess these skills are much more likely to be successful (Efklides, 2011; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000). Given the demands on course content, learning objectives, and outcomes, instructors rarely explicitly address students’ self-regulatory strategy use (Dignath-van Ewijk & Van der Werf, 2012). Moreover, students’ self-efficacy is a significant contributor and predictor of success (Bandura, 1993). These effects are often more pronounced within mathematics, statistics, or other STEM courses (see e.g. Nunez-Pena, Suarez-Pellicioni, & Bono, 2013).

This Discovery Session will introduce how self-regulated learning, self-efficacy, affect, and anxiety are directly addressed through formative assessments and class discussions. Although these strategies have been used in graduate statistics courses, they are more widely applicable. Specifically, students are asked to complete the self-regulated learning component of the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS; see https://daacs.net for more information; Bryer, et al, 2019) along with the Math Anxiety Scale Survey (Bai, Wang, Pan, & Frey, 2011) to supplement the DAACS assessment with domain specific information. In addition to providing the instructor with information about students’ self-regulatory skills, DAACS provides students with personalized feedback, suggested strategies, and links to additional open education resources. Within the first week of the course, student data is aggregated and presented to them. I use this as an opportunity to motivate discussions addressing, at minimum, the following questions:

1. What surprised you about your results?
2. What strategies do you currently use that you can rely on to be successful this semester?
3. What strategies were recommended that you think you can work on this semester?

In addition to getting students to think about their own learning, this often provides an opportunity to reinforce that they are not in this alone. For example, given that I teach statistics many students indicate that they have low affect and high anxiety when it comes to statistics, and mathematics more broadly. My goal in discussing these outcomes is to: 1) Indicate that they are not alone; 2) Share strategies to help deal with anxiety and to build efficacy; and 3) Reinforce that they should not be ashamed of these feelings and that there are supports available, including engaging with me as the instructor.

At the completing of this Discover Session participants will have a list of resources, including the technological implementation, and strategies they can use with their students to directly address students self-regulated learning knowledge and strategy use.
